Idra'ak: An Urdu sign language to Urdu text translator

# Problem Statement
The lack of sufficient progress made in Urdu sign language domain affects the people who express themselves in real time using Urdu sign language, as well as those who wish to communicate with them, which leaves a considerable chunk of the population, over five percent in fact, unable to communicate with others easily. The impact of this is far deeper than is evident. Apart from these disabled people not holding the power of expression, they are also ridiculed and misunderstood due to there being not enough awareness of the issue. A simple and accessible mobile application would be an effective solution to this issue, as the person not understanding Urdu Sign language would be able to quickly infer what is being signed and awareness would be greatly raised. 

# Objectives
As an end product, Idra’ak will be an Android Application that takes input of a person signing (video) in Urdu Sign Language and translates that to Urdu text, which is generated on the screen to be read, with the additional option of the corresponding Urdu audio to be played, thus enabling:
* Disabled people to express themselves
* People who can’t understand Urdu sign Language to translate signs to text
* People who can’t read Urdu text to play the audio and comprehend

# Scope
* Sign Language to text translation 
* Urdu Language (signed words and text)
* Urdu text to Urdu Audio (for illiterate people)
* Signs (35 - 40) (Narrowed down to primary level student’s (Alphabet))
